# sopraBigDataModule

Preference Learning and Recommender Web Service.

## Context

This module is a school project realised in partnership with [Sopra Steria's HR Lab](http://www.soprahr.com/fr). The aim was to provide them with a way to integrate Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques to their auto-adaptative User Interface.

## Realisation

The solution uses the users' appreciation of widgets and apps to recommend them to Sopra's software. It is built as a Web Service to which the main piece of software can send requests like "Which widgets and apps should I display to user lambda ?", giving responses as "From what we know of this user's preferences, we would recommend to display widgets [3, 2, 5, 1, 4] and apps [B, A, D, E, C] (in this order)".
